# Snowman
Snowman is meant to be a voice controlled personal assistant currently limited to
iTunes.
The reason I started making this begins with my Wemo smart plug. With my Wemo
smart plug, I can sit in bed and tell Alexa to turn off the lights. I wanted to
do that with my music as well, so I figured that I might as well automate this.
